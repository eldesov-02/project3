        Kazakh traditional sports are still practiced in Kazakhstan during national celebrations. ISKER Group provides sponsorship and takes an active part in such events because Kazakh sports are integral parts of national culture. Endless Eurasian steppes and
        challenging local climate had a tremendous influence on the building of Kazakh national culture. The nomadic lifestyle required Kazakh men and women to be physically tough horse riders and skillful hunters. This fact is reflected in the nature
        of Kazakh national sports and games the majority of which are equestrian competitions.

                    The name of the sport comes from Kazakh words and means “a grey wolf.” Kokpar is considered to be a kind of polo. This is a very popular masculine sport where two teams (from five to ten persons in each) of horse riders grapple over a decapitated goat,
                    which they try to deposit in the opponent’s goal. The distance between two goalposts is 300-400 meters. It lasts 15 minutes. In case of a draw, horsemen have the second round. If there is no result again, a competition between two
                    players is organized.
